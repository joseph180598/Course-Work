The book is the diary of a woman\\'s life as she tries to live\\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women\\'s right to own property is revoked,\\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\\nhunted down and hanged.

DICK  Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thoughtprovoking short  stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times but very approachable. He wrote mainly SF but he wrote about people truth and religion rather than technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God he remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels the following are of some   Galactic PotHealer A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers pothealer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply.  A polished ironic and amusing novel.  A Maze of Death Noteworthy for its description of a technologybased religion.  VALIS The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.  The Divine Invasion God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24hour easy listening music.  MARGARET ATWOOD  The Handmaid's Tale A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it right again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished  doctors who performed legal abortions in the old world are hunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to at first but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.  VARIOUS AUTHORS  The Bible This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However it is probably worth reading if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is about.  It exists in many different versions so make sure you get the one true version.

Argues both for negative atheism (i.e. the nonbelief in the existence of god and also for positive atheism (the belief in the nonexistence of god.

Focusses on the period 17701900 and while considering France and Britain the emphasis is on American and particularly New England developments.

Quite a number of the quotations are derived from Cardiff's What Great Men Think of Religion and Noyes' Views of Religion. 490 pages. ISBN  034529887X.  RICHARD SWINBURNE  The Existence of God  Clarendon Paperbacks Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with The Coherence of Theism .  In this work Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God.  His arguments which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived were decisively rejected in Mackie's The Miracle of Theism.  In the revised edition of The Existence of God Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.  J. L. MACKIE  The Miracle of Theism Oxford This  volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes Anselm Berkeley Hume et al through the moral arguments of Newman Kant and Sidgwick to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational such as those of Kierkegaard Kung and Philips as well as replacements for God such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read  less formalistic and better written than Martin's works and refreshingly direct when compared with the handwaving of Swinburne.  JAMES A.
